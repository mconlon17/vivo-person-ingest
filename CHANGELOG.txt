     -- Improve filtering of source data for start and end dates

     -- Catch deptid exception for update_position
     -- merged with forked version that fixed resource type assertions
     Version 0.5 cpb@ufl.edu 2013-08-05

     Version 0.6 MC 2013-08-07
     -- Fix classification error for Case 1/2 determination
     -- Read new format for privacy_data
     Version 0.7 MC 2013-08-11

     -- Read privacy data as a CSV
     -- map contact data elements from UF names to VIVO names
     -- improvements in position and working titles

     Version 0.8 MC 2013-08-26
     -- Only edit the UF working title if it is all upper case
     -- Add a space after the comma in the display name if needed
     -- Handle additional abbreviations in position and working titles
     -- Case 2 now removes preferred titles correctly
     -- Improve run time by improving contact data only if we are going
        to use it.  So we improve 40,000 instead of 2M
     -- Improve run time by using action report to reduce the size of privacy
        and contact dictionaries
     -- Fix bug in add regarding start dates
     -- For case 1, show the person URI in the log when added
     -- Improved indenting in RDF for add person

     -- Fix bug in case 1 counting
     -- Fix bug in update_contact for preferred_title
     -- Fixed bugs in escaping output
     Version 0.91 MC 2013-09-08
     -- Add URI exception list for people with UFID, but who are not on the UF
        pay list.  Anyone on the URI exception list will not be processed at
        all. They are, in effect, manual edit only.  Because they have a UFID,
        they will accumulate other facts -- grants, courses.  If they are
        manually edited to include UFEntity, they will have papers added as
        well.
     -- Remove all references to homeDeptFor.  This will be added by the
        inferencer as an inverse property to homeDept
     Version 0.92 MC 2013-09-08
     -- URI Exception list handling added to case 3
     Version 0.93 MC 2013-10-03
     -- Added foaf:Person assertion to add_person
     Version 0.94 MC 2013-10-05
     -- Check for ok_position to see if position should be added (case 1 and
        case 3).  We only add HR positions, not the "positions" from course
        ingest (HR_POSITION=0) which are used to add new people.  We do not
        add positions to excluded departments.
    Version 0.95 MC 2013-10-17
     -- Add Ops Lump Sum Payment to list of excluded position titles
    Version 0.96 MC 2013-12-11
     -- Correct support for adding people without positions
    Version 0.97 MC 2013-12-16
     -- Support adding people without home departments
    Version 0.98 MC 2014-02-24
    --  Fix email addresses on the way in
	Version 2.00 MC 2014-07-20
	--  prepare_people reads data, handles all exception processing.  Relies on 
	    six shelves.  See create_shelves
	--  Unicode support throughout
	--  Position title exceptions added as a shelve, managed externally
	--  position data now has one additional field -- COMMENT -- normally empty for production records.  Typically
		used for annotating test records

    Future enhancements:
     -- For case 2, close end dates for positions with explicit HR data rather
        than inferring an end date via the absence of HR data
     -- read external sources into standard tag name structures.  Do not carry
        local names (JOBCODE_DESCRIPTION) into the code.
     -- explore data source and process for assigning person type Librarian. UF
        marks librarians as Faculty in HR data.  No indication that the person
        is a librarian by salary plan
